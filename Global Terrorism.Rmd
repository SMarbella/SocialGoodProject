## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r global terrorism}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
gtd_data <- read.csv("globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(gtd_data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
gtd_clean <- gtd_data %>%
  select(iyear, country_txt, attacktype1_txt, nkill) %>%
  filter(!is.na(nkill))
# Removes rows where nkill (fatalities) is NA

# View a summary of cleaned data.
summary(gtd_data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
